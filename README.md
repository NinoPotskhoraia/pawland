# pawland
This is my most recent JavaScript project. I wanted to brush
up on my vanilla JS skills and challenged myself to create a
photo slider and form validation using plain JavaScript. I had
only created these features with the help of internet
resources and I decided not to relay on them this time. I had
a little bit of fun with the theme, I adore cats so that is
how PawLand was born. Project is responsive.
